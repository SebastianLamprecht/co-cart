## Testimonials

What can I say this thing has it all. It is the ‚ÄúMissing WooCommerce REST API plugin‚Äù without it I was managing users cart myself in weird and wonderful but hacky ways. NOT GOOD and so vulnerable. Then I stumbled upon CoCart and with the help of Seb I got it working how I needed it and he has been supporting me with even the smallest of queries. Really appreciate your work and continued support Seb.

***

This plugin was critical to achieve my project of building a headless / decoupled WooCommerce store. I wanted to provide my clients with a CMS to manage their store, but wanted to build the front-end in React. I was able to fetch content over the WooCommerce REST API, but otherwise would not have been able to fetch the cart, and add & remove items if not for this plugin.

Thank you very much S√©bastien for sharing this extension, you‚Äôve saved me a lot of time.

Thanks for doing such a great work with this! Works exactly as expected and CoCart seems to have a nice community around it. The founder seems really devoted and that‚Äôs one of the key things for a plugin like this to live on and get the right updates in the future. We just got ourselves the lifetime subscription.
